Dehraadun Diary is inspired by the real life murder case of Nitish Katara, who was killed by the relatives of his lover Bharti Yadav in 2002. The film tries to depict the plight of the common man who has to face the wrath of the powerful and corrupt politicians who can manipulate the law and order system to their advantage. The film also highlights the issue of honour killing, which is still prevalent in some parts of India, where people are killed for marrying outside their caste or religion.
 
The film has been criticized for its poor execution, lack of authenticity and weak direction. The film fails to create any suspense or thrill and relies on cliched dialogues and melodrama. The film also suffers from poor editing, cinematography and music. The film does not do justice to the real life story and fails to evoke any sympathy or emotion for the characters. The film has been rated 1.5 out of 5 by Times of India and 5.8 out of 10 by IMDb.
 
Dehraadun Diary is a film that could have been a powerful and gripping thriller, but ends up being a dull and disappointing affair. The film does not offer anything new or engaging and is a waste of time and money. The film is not recommended for anyone who is looking for a quality cinema experience.
